# ComputerArchitecture-ARM-Labs
Various ARM Assembly projects

Three lab projects written for ARM assembly on Raspberry Pi. Created for Digital Computer Architecture class.

* Lab 1 reads input from a user, sums it, and prints it
* Lab 2 simulates a vending machine using subroutines
* Lab 3 implements a high-level language instruction that moves data directly from memory to memory

See PDFs in each lab folder for a detailed description of the functionality.
